BigDataBench is an open-source comprehensive big data benchmark suite. Since the first release in June 2013, more than 20 research groups and industry partners worldwide have published papers using BigDataBench. The current version BigDataBench-3.0 includes 77 workloads covering four types of applications (cloud OLTP, OLAP, interactive analytics, offline analytics) and three popular internet scenarios (search engine, social network, e-commerce).
These workloads cover both basic operations and state-of-art algorithms, and each operation/algorithm has multiple implementations built upon mainstream software stacks (Hadoop and Spark).
In short, BigDataBench aims at providing comprehensive workloads in order to meet the needs of benchmark users from different research fields, for example, architecture field, system field and networking field.
