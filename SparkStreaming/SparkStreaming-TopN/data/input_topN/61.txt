At last, The tool is implemented in Python. It %has integrated several statistical functions and visual functions. The statistical functions are used to normalize performance data, and perform principle component analysis. The visual functions are used to plot different kinds of graphs. In our implementation, we
uses \emph{matplotlib} as our graphic library and \emph{numpy} and \emph{scipy} as our statistical libraries.
%The following section will give the details of out tool.
%the performance data they collected to downsizing analyzer over network.

%\subsection{Profiler}
%The profiler can collect multi-level performance metrics.
%In our implementation, this function relies on the existing profiling tools in Linux such as Perf.
%We use Python scripts to drive Perf, a profiling tool for Linux 2.6+ based systems, to access hardware Performance Counter Unit (PMU).
