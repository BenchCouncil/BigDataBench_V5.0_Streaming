However, the broad spectrum of representative applications is multiplied by different software stack implementations, which bring cognitive difficulty of workload characterization and benchmarking costs.
%for the architecture community,  that usually evaluates new design using simulators.
%makes it expensive to organize experiments and get valuable insights from experiments, especially for architectural researches that usually evaluate new design using simulators.

In order to reduce complexity and costs of workload characterization analysis, we develop a comprehensive workload characterization tool, which can subset the whole workload set through removing redundant ones. In addition, this tool also can collect, analyze, and visualize a large number of performance metrics.
%ranging from micro-architecture level metrics e.g. the number of cache miss per thousand instructions, to operating system level metrics e.g. the number of context switches per second.
%In order to get deeper insight, in our tool we also integrate some important statistical methods in workloads characterization inspired by previous research ~\cite{eeckhout2003quantifying,eeckhout2002workload,phiansalkar2007analysisab,phansalkar2007subsetting}.
%We will open source our tool, so that other researchers can use it to get valuable information in an acceptable time.
