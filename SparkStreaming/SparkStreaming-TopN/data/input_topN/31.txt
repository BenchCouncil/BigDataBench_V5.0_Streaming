%And then we will collect the performance data. This is the last step that we need to do manually.
%After running each workload, the collector module in performance data analyzer will collect all the data from each profiler.
%Then the collector will store those raw data into the database.
%Those raw data will be normalized by instructions, cycles, second and etc, according to different definitions of metrics. That is to say, the tool calculates the metrics automatically, e.g calculating IPC by diving total instructions by total cycles, calculating L1 data cache misses per thousand instructions by diving total L1 data cache misses by the number of thousand instructions executed.
%This is because the raw data is meaningless for most of the time. Such as the total number of L1 instruction cache misses does not give much information for different workloads have different running time.
%The meaningful metric should be L1 instruction cache missed per thousand instruct. %So the raw data should be
%because different workloads have different running time and most of raw data are skewed by running time.
%So the raw data should be normalized by time or cycles according to the definition of metrics, such as cache misses per thousand instructions, context switches per second.

%After that, the performance data analyzer will produce two kinds of outputs --- workload subset and performance data visualization.%, whose numbers are labeled in figure \ref{tool}.
% In the following sections, we will introduce how our tool  produces those kinds of outputs.

%\subsubsection{Workload Subsetting} \label{remove-correlation}
%The broad spectrum of representative applications make it prohibitively expensive to perform evaluation with all workloads especially for simulator based research. Inspired by previous research~\cite{eeckhout2003quantifying,eeckhout2002workload,phiansalkar2007analysisab,phansalkar2007subsetting}, this tool can produce a subset of the whole set of workloads according to the performance data profiler collected. The procedure is showed in Figure~\ref{tool}.
%Removing correlation is needed before subsetting.
