%And then we will collect the performance data. This is the last step that we need to do manually.
%After running each workload, the collector module in performance data analyzer will collect all the data from each profiler.
%Then the collector will store those raw data into the database.
%Those raw data will be normalized by instructions, cycles, second and etc, according to different definitions of metrics. That is to say, the tool calculates the metrics automatically, e.g calculating IPC by diving total instructions by total cycles, calculating L1 data cache misses per thousand instructions by diving total L1 data cache misses by the number of thousand instructions executed.
%This is because the raw data is meaningless for most of the time. Such as the total number of L1 instruction cache misses does not give much information for different workloads have different running time.
%The meaningful metric should be L1 instruction cache missed per thousand instruct. %So the raw data should be
%because different workloads have different running time and most of raw data are skewed by running time.
