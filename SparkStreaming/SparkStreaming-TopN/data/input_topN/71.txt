%because different workloads have different running time and most of raw data are skewed by running time.
%So the raw data should be normalized by time or cycles according to the definition of metrics, such as cache misses per thousand instructions, context switches per second.

%After that, the performance data analyzer will produce two kinds of outputs --- workload subset and performance data visualization.%, whose numbers are labeled in figure \ref{tool}.
