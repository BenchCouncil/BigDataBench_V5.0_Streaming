%The rapid development of distributed systems has led to the proliferation of massive distributed applications, covering a wide range of domains, from search engine, social networks to e-commerce.
A comprehensive benchmark suite should cover a broad spectrum of representative
applications of different types, as well as state-of-the-art software stacks.
%On the other hand, most of the emerging workloads are executed in a distributed manner.
%The distributed workloads, no matter traditional HPC workloads or stat-of-art data center workloads, can run on large-scale clusters, whose scales range from several nodes to thousands of nodes.
%The large scale of clusters together with
However, the broad spectrum of representative applications is multiplied by different software stack implementations, which bring cognitive difficulty of workload characterization and benchmarking costs.
%for the architecture community,  that usually evaluates new design using simulators.
%makes it expensive to organize experiments and get valuable insights from experiments, especially for architectural researches that usually evaluate new design using simulators.

In order to reduce complexity and costs of workload characterization analysis, we develop a comprehensive workload characterization tool, which can subset the whole workload set through removing redundant ones. In addition, this tool also can collect, analyze, and visualize a large number of performance metrics.
