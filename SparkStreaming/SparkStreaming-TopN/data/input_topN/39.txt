When using the tool, we normalize these metric values to a Gaussian distribution and use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions. Running the tool, we reduce 45 metrics to 9 principle components, the sum of whose eigenvalues accounts for 89.3 percentage of the sum of all eigenvalues. And then we use K-Means to cluster the 77 workloads, and there are 17 clusters in the final results.

Since the workloads in the same cluster are similar, we could choose one to represent the workloads in the cluster. There are two methods for choosing the representative workload from each cluster: 1) select the workload that is as close as possible to the center of the cluster it belongs to, and 2) select the extreme workload situated at the boundary of each cluster. We select the workload situated at the boundary of each cluster as the
representative workload. The rationale behind the approach would be that the behavior of the workloads in the middle of a cluster can be extracted from the behavior of the boundary.

The final 17 workloads reduced for architecture researchers are listed in Table~\ref{reduing workloads}.  In Table~\ref{reduing workloads}, we give a simple description of each representative big data workload, and describe each workload from the perspective of system behavior, data behaviors and application category.
\subsubsection{\textbf{System Behaviors}}

We choose CPU Usages, DISK IO behaviors and IO Bandwidth to analyze
the system behaviors of big data workloads. First, the CPU usages are
described by CPU utilization and IO Wait ratio. CPU utilization is defined as the percentage of time that the CPU executing at system or user level, while I/O Wait ratio is defined as the percentage of time that the CPU waiting for outstanding disk I/O requests. Second, DISK I/O performance is a key metric of big data workloads. We investigate the DISK I/O behavior, which are described by the weighted Disk I/O time ratio. Weighted Disk I/O time is defined as weighted number of milliseconds spent doing I/Os since the last update, and the average weighted Disk I/O time ratio is the weighted Disk I/O time divided by the running time of the workload. Third, we choose the Disk I/O Bandwidth, Network I/O Bandwidth and Memory Bandwidth to describe IO Bandwidth, which can reflect the I/O throughput requirements of big data workloads.

In order to better understand system behaviors, we roughly classify the workloads into three categories: (1)\emph{CPU-Intensive workloads},
which have high CPU utilization, low average weighted Disk I/O time ratio or I/O Bandwidth; for example, in our experiments, if the workload's CPU utilization is larger than 85\%, we consider it CPU-Intensive. (2)\emph{I/O-Intensive workloads}, which have high average weighted Disk I/O time ratio or I/O Bandwidth but low CPU utilization; such as, the workload's average weighted Disk I/O time ratio larger than 10 or the I/O Wait ratio larger than 20\%, and the CPU utilization less than 60\%, we consider it  I/O-Intensive; (3)\emph{Hybrid workloads}, whose behaviors are between CPU-Intensive workloads and IO-Intensive workloads. The three system behaviours categories of our 17 workloads are shown in Table \ref{reduing workloads}.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Data Behaviors}}
We choose data schema and data processing behaviors£¬which can be used to characterize the data behaviors. For data schema, we will describe the data structure and semantic information of each workload. For data processing behaviors, we will describe the Data Input ratio, Data Output ratio and Intermediate Data ratio to describe. For example, when Data Output ratio to Data Input ratio is larger than or equal to 0.9 and less than 1.1, we consider \emph{Output=Input}; when Data Output ratio to Data Input ratio is larger than or equal to 0.01 and less than 0.9, we consider \emph{Output\textless Input}; when  Data Output ratio to Data Input ratio is less than 0.01, we consider \emph{Output\textless\textless Input}; when Data Output ratio to  Data Input ratio is greater than or equal to 1.1, we consider \emph{Output\textgreater Input}. The rule is inspired by Luo et al.~\cite{luo2012cloudrank}.
